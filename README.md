# Digital Scholarship Foundations Static Website Series

## Workshop Overview

Digital Scholarship Foundations is a series of library workshops led by [Digital Scholarship Services (DiScho)](https://library.princeton.edu/services/digital-scholarship).

Our fall program is centered around websites to develop fundamental skills necessary for successful digital projects. Weâ€™ll look under the hood of a website to demystify the anatomy of the web and explore how to build critical and sustainable projects. Participants will attend four workshops and use common digital tools and methods as they construct their own website. During these sessions we will learn about version control, metadata, web publishing, and more.

## Digital Scholarship at PUL

DiScho offers [regular programming](https://library.princeton.edu/services/digital-scholarship/digital-scholarship-workshops-and-events) every semester that focus on data, digital publishing, and more. Our colleagues in the library also [offer workshops](https://libcal.princeton.edu/calendar?cid=-1&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=-1&inc=0) that may be of interest to digital scholarship practitioners.

The weekly sessions borrow from [Learn-Static](https://learn-static.github.io/). Their [modules](https://learn-static.github.io/modules/) and [templates](https://learn-static.github.io/templates/) are great for developing your own curriculum or pursuing asynchronous learning. [Evan Will's go-go gh-pages](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages-b/) is a related project that also includes materials that have shaped this series.
