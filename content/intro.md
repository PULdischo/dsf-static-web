DSF Static Websites is a four-part workshop series that introduces you to static website generation and the underlying skills that make creating your own website possible. Our series is influenced by the [Lib-Static approach](https://lib-static.github.io/about/).

## Credits
The weekly sessions borrow from [Learn-Static](https://learn-static.github.io/). Their [modules](https://learn-static.github.io/modules/) and [templates](https://learn-static.github.io/templates/) are great for developing your own curriculum or pursuing asynchronous learning.
