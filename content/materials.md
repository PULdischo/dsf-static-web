We've collected and listed the materials you will need to succeed in this series. We will walk you through installing and using  any software listed here.

## Software and Tools

`GitHub:` [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a version control platform that enables collaboration and facilitates the simplification of static site generation through their [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service.

`GitHub Desktop:` The [GitHub Desktop client](https://github.com/apps/desktop) simplifies version control and makes it easier to move between a remote and local repository.

`A Text Editor:` The instructor will use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in all demonstrations so if you do not have a preferred text editor, we recommend downloading the software. Please confirm that your computer meets [the system requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements). Feel free to wait to download the software until one of our sessions.

`Google Sheets:` We will avoid Excel and build metadata spreadsheets in Google Sheets.

`CollectionBuilder:` [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) is an open source framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.

`A Development Environment:` Developing locally is more efficient and will help you learn more about your computer. While this course can be completed without a local development environment, we will follow [CollectionBuilder's guidelines](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/) to enable local development. We have also isolated the key components for this workshop series:

- [Install Ruby](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/ruby/): Note that there are different installation steps depending on your operating system, select Mac, Windows, or Linux based on your computer. 
- After you successfully install Ruby, you can [install Jekyll](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/jekyll/). If needed, you can also consult [Jekyll's documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
- Check and [configure git](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/git/):
    - The command line can tell you if you have git, before you try to download it.
    - Be sure to follow the path for your computer/operating system.
    - Ignore the install GitHub Desktop part of the documentation if you already completed that step during an earlier session.

## Research Materials

You will need to bring research materials to this course to successfully build a prototype of your project. These materials do not need to be perfect or complete by the start of our sessions. Our goal is create a proof-of-concept, not a highly polished and completed project.

`Research objects:` These can be image files, PDFs, mp3s, etc. You can have as few as 5-10 objects to build a successful prototype.

`Metadata:` Metadata is data about data. You will need information about your research objects such as title, author/creator, object description, location of origin, and potentially more depending on your project vision.

`Textual content:` You will want to contextualize your objects with more than just the metadata you have collected. 

`Other multimedia:` While video, audio, timelines, maps, and more may not be your research objects, that can help contextualize and/or complement your research objects.
