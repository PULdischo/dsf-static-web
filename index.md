Our fall program is centered around websites to develop fundamental skills necessary for successful digital projects. Weâ€™ll look under the hood of a website to demystify the anatomy of the web and explore how to build critical and sustainable projects. Participants will attend four workshops and use common digital tools and methods as they construct their own website. During these sessions we will learn about version control, metadata, web publishing, and more.
